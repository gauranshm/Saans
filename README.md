# SAANS website (Next.js)

The SAANS marketing site, rebuilt from the SAANS design handoff (reference HTML + playbook).
The handoff itself is kept outside this repo (`design_handoff/` is git-ignored); copy is kept word for word.

Next.js 16 App Router · React 19 · TypeScript · CSS Modules · no UI framework.

## Run

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values, see "Waitlist setup"
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
npm run build && npm start   # production
```

The waitlist forms need Supabase. Until it is configured they show an error, never a fake success.
The clinician and college forms are separate: without `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT` they still simulate
success after 700 ms and **send nothing anywhere**.

## Waitlist setup

The modal and the home page form both POST to the site's own `/api/waitlist`, which writes to the
`public.waitlist` table with the secret key. The browser never talks to Supabase, and the table has RLS on
with no policies and no privileges for `anon` or `authenticated`.

**1. The table** is already created on the project. Its migration is kept out of this repo
(`supabase/migrations/` is git-ignored), so a new project needs that file from the team, run once in the
dashboard's SQL Editor.

**2. Set the env vars** in the host's settings (and in `.env.local` for local runs):

| Variable | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Project Settings → Data API → Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | Project Settings → API Keys → a secret key (`sb_secret_…`), or the legacy `service_role` key |
| `TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` | Optional. Leave unset on Vercel. On Netlify: `x-nf-client-connection-ip` |

The secret key bypasses RLS: keep it server-side and never give it a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

**Limits to know about:** rate limiting is in-memory, so on serverless each instance counts on its own
(details in `src/lib/waitlist/rate-limit.ts`). To remove someone from the list, delete their row in the SQL
Editor; the server's key deliberately can only read and insert.

### Testing it

`tests/waitlist.e2e.mjs` drives the real forms in a browser against a production build and a real database.
Nothing is mocked. It needs Edge and `playwright-core` (paths at the top of the script, or set
`WAITLIST_TEST_BROWSER` and `WAITLIST_TEST_PLAYWRIGHT_FROM`), free ports 3300–3304, and a git-ignored
`.env.test.local`:

```bash
WAITLIST_TEST_DATABASE_URL=   # Postgres connection string (hosted: dashboard, Connect, Session pooler)
WAITLIST_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_KEY= # publishable key (or WAITLIST_TEST_ANON_KEY on older projects), used to prove it is locked out
```

Local stack (needs Docker): `npx supabase start`, then `npx supabase status -o env` for all the values.
`SUPABASE_URL` is `API_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is `SECRET_KEY`, and the database URL is `DB_URL`.

```bash
npm run build && npm run test:waitlist
```

Against a hosted project it writes only rows with a per-run `e2e-…@example.com` address and deletes those at the end.

## Structure

  lib/                 content.ts (all shared copy), forms.ts, analytics.ts, waitlist/ (validation, rate limit, Supabase)
```

### How things work

- **Theme**: dark by default. An inline script in `<head>` reads `localStorage['saans-theme-v3']` before hydration.
  Everything themes through CSS variables in `globals.css`.
- **Popups**: `useModal().open('waitlist' | 'clinician' | 'college' | 'breath' | 'help' | 'film')`, or
  `<ModalButton modal="…">` from server components. One `ModalShell` handles scrim, focus trap, Esc,
  focus return, scroll lock, enter/exit animation and the phone bottom sheet.
- **Forms**: `lib/forms.ts`. Waitlist forms → `/api/waitlist` → Supabase (`lib/waitlist/`). Clinician and college
  forms → single POST to `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT` with `type: clinician | college`.
- **Smooth scrolling**: Lenis (`components/layout/SmoothScroll.tsx`), paused under popups; off for reduced motion.
- **Hero intro**: `[data-intro]` CSS in `globals.css`, started by the `<head>` script once the heading font is ready.
- **Reveal motion**: any element with `data-reveal="up|scale|fade"` (+ `data-reveal-delay`) animates in once.
  Reduced motion turns all motion off.
- **Analytics**: `lib/analytics.ts` pushes the README §12 events to `window.dataLayer`.
- **Laptop zoom**: `.page{zoom:.86}` at 1000–1599px wide (and `.8`/`.74` on short screens), never on modals.

## Before launch (placeholders)

- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (env vars)
- The X / Instagram / LinkedIn links → `src/lib/content.ts`
- Privacy policy and terms text
- Film captions → put a `.vtt` in `public/film/` and set `FILM_CAPTIONS` in `src/components/modals/FilmModal.tsx`

## Deploy

Vercel: import the repo, defaults. Netlify: build `next build` (runtime auto-detected).
Set the env vars above in the host's settings.
